"""Compose a current picture from a primary run plus scoped supplementary runs.

    uv run python tools/compose_runs.py results/runs/PRIMARY.json \
        results/runs/SUPP1.json [results/runs/SUPP2.json ...] [--json out.json]

**This never writes to `results/runs/`.** The ledger contract
(`results/README.md`) is explicit: *"Run files are immutable"* and *"No
fabricated or backfilled runs — a ledger entry is written by the ingester from
real harness output, never by hand."* Splicing later scores into an earlier run
file would also make that file's own `ff`, `workers` and `build` metadata a lie
about how its rows were produced, which is exactly the trap that made the
2026-08-03 `ff=experimental` misdiagnosis possible.

So the composition happens in the *analysis*, not in the record. Each active case
is resolved to its most recent valid measurement at its **current uid**:
supplementary runs win over the primary, later supplementary runs win over
earlier. Every row is reported with its provenance so the result is auditable,
and rows nothing measured are called out rather than quietly dropped.
