"""Unit tests for tools/compose_runs.py.

The composition exists because the ledger contract forbids the obvious shortcut
(writing later scores into an earlier run file), so the properties that matter are:
freshest-measurement-wins, current-uid-only, nothing silently dropped, and no
ledger file written.

Usage
$ uv run python -m pytest tests/test_compose_runs.py -v
