"""Unit tests for the answer judge's numeric tolerance.

The judge only extracts which number in the prose answers the question
(`extracted_number`); `resolve_answer_verdict` applies the tolerance in code, the
same way `resolve_chart_verdict` already does for charts — except a deterministic
FAIL here falls back to the judge's own score (asymmetrically: never a PASS),
because the parser is locale-blind in a way the judge is not (1-091, 1-094).
What's testable without an API call: that the tolerance constant is single-sourced
and reaches the prompt, that the prompt does not ask the model to compute a match
itself, that splicing the fragment in has not broken the LangChain placeholders (a
stray `{` in a shared fragment becomes a template variable and the judge call fails
at runtime), and that the deterministic-vs-judge combination behaves correctly on
its own.
