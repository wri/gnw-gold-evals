"""Unit tests for the answer judge's numeric tolerance.

The tolerance is prose inside a prompt, so what can be tested without an API call is
that it is single-sourced, that it reaches the prompt, and that splicing it in has not
broken the LangChain placeholders. That last one matters: a stray `{` in a shared
fragment becomes a template variable and the judge call fails at runtime.

`llm_judge_chart` intentionally has no tolerance rule — see the comment on
NUMERIC_TOLERANCE and llm/TASKS.md.

Usage
$ uv run python -m pytest tests/test_numeric_tolerance.py -v
