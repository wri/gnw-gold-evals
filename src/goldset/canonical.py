"""Content-addressed identity for GOLD cases.

A case's ``uid`` is a truncated SHA-256 over a canonical JSON serialisation
of its query plus every non-empty expectation. Editing the prompt or any
expected value therefore mints a new uid; metadata (status, group, notes)
does not participate, so triage annotations never masquerade as a new
version of the test.

The ``caseset_version`` is a hash over the sorted uids of every case in the
store: any edit to any case, or adding/removing one, changes the set
version. Results ledgers key on both, so a score is always pinned to the
exact case content it ran against.
