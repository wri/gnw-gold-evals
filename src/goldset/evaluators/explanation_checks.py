"""Explanation-bucket validator (PR-06 E1): answer traceability.

The deterministic "does the answer mislead" check: the headline number the
prose asserts must be derivable from the charts shown beside it (leaf, sum,
max, or share, within the shared 2% tolerance). Expectation-free — it
compares the agent's own outputs, so it runs on any row with a chart and a
bolded numeric claim.

Evidence (run 6): of 63 extractable headline numbers, 15 were not traceable
to the chart data; 1-027's "**679.16 hectares**" appears nowhere in its own
chart. All of them scored ``agent_answer`` 1.0.

Precision over recall: only **bolded** segments are considered claims (the
answer template bolds key findings), and the number parser inherits
chart_numeric's abstention rules (years skipped, ambiguous locale decimals
abstain) — a multilingual row that can't be parsed safely is a ``None``,
never a guess.
