"""Deterministic guards: cheap checks for failures the other checks miss.

An answer can pass ``agent_answer`` with no data behind it, or with no chart at
all. These guards catch that:

- ``chart_produced``: a case with an expected answer must produce a chart.
- ``answered_without_data``: fails a substantive answer given with no data pull
  and no dataset selected.
- ``web_fallback``: fails an answer that links to outside sites, a sign it came
  from web knowledge rather than pulled data.
- ``pull_source_match``: the data pull must use the expected dataset.

The first three run only on cases that expect a data pull. Each guard scores 1.0
when clean, 0.0 when violated, and ``None`` when it does not apply.
``pull_source_match`` also scores ``None`` when the pull records no dataset id,
and says why in ``actual_pull_source``.
