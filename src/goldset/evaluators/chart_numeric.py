"""Deterministic numeric check for chart rows.

`llm_judge_chart` cannot be trusted with the arithmetic. Asked about a chart whose 25
yearly values sum to 25.31 Mha, it reported that same chart as summing to 27.4 Mha and to
26.0 Mha, each "within tolerance" of whatever expected value it had been handed. So the
comparison happens here instead: the expected figure is parsed from the sheet, the
candidate figures are computed from the chart's own encoded data, and the model is left to
judge only whether the chart is an appropriate, complete answer to the query.

Support is deliberately three-valued. `None` means "no numeric claim to check" — a year, a
bare place name, or a figure whose decimal separator is ambiguous — and leaves the verdict
entirely to the judge.
