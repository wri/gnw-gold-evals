"""Deterministic numeric check for chart rows.

Decides whether a chart's own data contains the figure in the case's expected
answer. The LLM chart judge is never asked to compare numbers, because its
arithmetic is unreliable: asked about a chart whose yearly values sum to 25.31 Mha,
it reported the same chart as summing to 27.4 Mha and to 26.0 Mha. Its view on
whether the chart suits the query is recorded as the info-only
`charts_answer_judge`.

Candidate figures come from the chart data: leaf values, column totals and maxima,
cross-column row sums and, when the expected figure is a percentage, each value's
share of its column total.

Support is three-valued: "supported", "unsupported", or `None` when there is no
numeric claim to check (a year, a place name, or a figure whose decimal separator
is ambiguous). `None` leaves `charts_answer` unscored; see `resolve_chart_verdict`
in `llm_judges.py`.
