"""Scope-bucket check: did the agent do the right kind of work?

Classifies the final state in code rather than with an LLM judge, because judges
were too unstable across trials for this.

Classes, in precedence order (an agent that pulled data has analysed, whatever
else it did):

    analyse:  a data pull happened
    suggest:  no pull; the agent offered datasets (a ``dataset_choice`` nudge,
              or the legacy ``suggested_datasets`` field)
    clarify:  no pull; any other nudge, for example ``aoi_choice``
    none:     none of the above (matches an expected ``refuse``)

Limitation: an agent that asks for clarification in prose without setting
``nudge`` classifies as ``none``. Set ``scope: clarify`` only on cases that
expect the agent to send a nudge.
