                **NUMERIC** (numbers with optional units):
                - Expected answer contains numbers: "198.4 hectares", "0.20%", "211 kha", "924,000 km²"
                - **Extraction rule**: Identify THE main answer number (usually stated as "total", "X hectares were", or the first/most prominent number directly answering the question) — not a breakdown/detail number.
                  - Example: "A total of 231.97 hectares were affected. Short vegetation had 176.36 ha..." → the main number is 231.97, not 176.36
                - Copy that number into `extracted_number` **exactly as written** in the actual answer, including its unit and sign (e.g. "200 hectares", "-286,994 Mg CO2e", "0.19%"). Do not convert units or round it — a deterministic check normally applies the {_TOLERANCE_PCT} tolerance to `extracted_number` in code instead of you computing it.
                - Still give `score` your own careful best judgement of whether the actual value matches the expected value (roughly {_TOLERANCE_PCT} or closer counts as a match) — use your understanding of the actual answer's language and numeric conventions (a decimal comma in French/German/Indonesian text, a non-English scale word, etc.). The deterministic check above cannot read those conventions, so when it disagrees with a PASS from you, your score is trusted instead — a mismatch there is usually the parser misreading the number, not the agent being wrong. A FAIL from you never overrides a deterministic PASS.
                - Leave `extracted_number` as an empty string for every answer type other than NUMERIC.

                ## Answer Type Detection & Scoring Rules

                **BOOLEAN** (true/false, yes/no questions):
                - Expected answer contains: "TRUE", "FALSE", "True", "False", "true", "false", "yes", "no", "Yes", "No"
                - Scoring: Exact semantic match required
                - **First, extract the boolean value from the actual answer** (usually at the start: "True", "False", "yes", "no")
                - **Then compare**: TRUE matches with yes/true/affirmative, FALSE matches with no/false/negative
                - Examples:
                  - Expected "TRUE" vs Actual "true" → MATCH (1)
                  - Expected "TRUE" vs Actual "yes" → MATCH (1)
                  - Expected "TRUE" vs Actual "False." → NO MATCH (0) [opposite values]
                  - Expected "TRUE" vs Actual "no" → NO MATCH (0) [opposite values]
                  - Expected "FALSE" vs Actual "TRUE" → NO MATCH (0) [opposite values]
                  - Expected "FALSE" vs Actual "false" → MATCH (1)
                  - Expected "TRUE" vs Actual "The statement is correct" → MATCH (1) [affirms without explicit FALSE]
                - **CRITICAL**: If the actual answer contains "False", "false", "no", or "No", it CANNOT match "TRUE". Vice versa.
"""

                **YEAR** (4-digit years):
                - Expected answer is a year: "2015", "2023"
                - Scoring: Exact match required
                - Examples:
                  - Expected "2015" vs Actual "2015" → MATCH (1)
                  - Expected "2015" vs Actual "2016" → NO MATCH (0)

                **NAMED_ENTITY** (countries, regions, places, land cover types):
                - Expected answer is a proper noun or descriptive term: "Brazil", "South Dakota"
                - Scoring: Semantic similarity - the actual answer should clearly identify the same entity or category
                - Examples:
                  - Expected "Brazil" vs Actual "Brazil had the most" → MATCH (1)

                1. First, identify which answer_eval_type the expected answer belongs to

                3. Return:

                   - answer_eval_type: one of "boolean", "numeric", "year", "named_entity"

                     copied verbatim from the actual answer (see the NUMERIC rules above);
                     an empty string for every other answer_eval_type

                Be strict with the rules above, especially for boolean, numeric, and year types.
