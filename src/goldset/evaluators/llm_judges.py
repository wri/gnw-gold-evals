                - **Extraction rule**: Identify THE main answer number (usually stated as "total", "X hectares were", or the first/most prominent number directly answering the question)
                - **Tolerance formula**: Calculate |actual - expected| / expected
                  - If result <= {NUMERIC_TOLERANCE} ({_TOLERANCE_PCT}), then MATCH (1)
                  - If result > {NUMERIC_TOLERANCE} ({_TOLERANCE_PCT}), then NO MATCH (0)
                - Examples of MATCH (within {_TOLERANCE_PCT} tolerance):
                  - Expected "198.4 hectares" vs Actual "200 hectares" → MATCH (1) [0.8% difference]
                  - Expected "211 kha" vs Actual "215 kha" → MATCH (1) [1.9% difference]
                  - Expected "100 hectares" vs Actual "102 hectares" → MATCH (1) [exactly {_TOLERANCE_PCT}, the boundary is inclusive]
                  - Expected "200 kha" vs Actual "200,000 hectares" → MATCH (1) [same value, different units]
                - Examples of NO MATCH (exceeds {_TOLERANCE_PCT} tolerance):
                  - Expected "100 hectares" vs Actual "103 hectares" → NO MATCH (0) [3% difference]
                  - Expected "0.20%" vs Actual "0.19%" → NO MATCH (0) [5% difference]
                  - Expected "211 kha" vs Actual "235 kha" → NO MATCH (0) [11.4% difference]
                  - Expected "198.4 hectares" vs Actual "232 hectares" → NO MATCH (0) [16.9% difference]
                - For percentages, compare the percentage values directly
                - **When multiple numbers present**: Use the number that directly answers the question, not breakdown/detail numbers
                  - Example: "A total of 231.97 hectares were affected. Short vegetation had 176.36 ha..." → Use 231.97, not 176.36

                2. Apply the appropriate comparison logic
                3. Return a score (0 or 1)

                ## Answer Type Detection & Scoring Rules

                **BOOLEAN** (true/false, yes/no questions):
                - Expected answer contains: "TRUE", "FALSE", "True", "False", "true", "false", "yes", "no", "Yes", "No"
                - Scoring: Exact semantic match required
                - **First, extract the boolean value from the actual answer** (usually at the start: "True", "False", "yes", "no")
                - **Then compare**: TRUE matches with yes/true/affirmative, FALSE matches with no/false/negative
                - Examples:
                  - Expected "TRUE" vs Actual "true" → MATCH (1)
                  - Expected "TRUE" vs Actual "yes" → MATCH (1)
                  - Expected "TRUE" vs Actual "False." → NO MATCH (0) [opposite values]
                  - Expected "TRUE" vs Actual "no" → NO MATCH (0) [opposite values]
                  - Expected "FALSE" vs Actual "TRUE" → NO MATCH (0) [opposite values]
                  - Expected "FALSE" vs Actual "false" → MATCH (1)
                  - Expected "TRUE" vs Actual "The statement is correct" → MATCH (1) [affirms without explicit FALSE]
                - **CRITICAL**: If the actual answer contains "False", "false", "no", or "No", it CANNOT match "TRUE". Vice versa.

                - Expected answer is a year: "2015", "2023"
                - Scoring: Exact match required
                - Examples:
                  - Expected "2015" vs Actual "2015" → MATCH (1)
                  - Expected "2015" vs Actual "2016" → NO MATCH (0)

                **NAMED_ENTITY** (countries, regions, places, land cover types):
                - Expected answer is a proper noun or descriptive term: "Brazil", "South Dakota"
                - Scoring: Semantic similarity - the actual answer should clearly identify the same entity or category
                - Examples:
                  - Expected "Brazil" vs Actual "Brazil had the most" → MATCH (1)

                1. First, identify which answer_eval_type the expected answer belongs to

                3. Return:

                   - reason: one concise sentence explaining why you gave that score
                   - answer_eval_type: one of "boolean", "numeric", "year", "named_entity"
