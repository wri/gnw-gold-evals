"""Nudge evaluator.

Checks the generic ``nudge`` state field (``{type, options}``) that the agent
emits via ``send_nudge`` or the ``pick_aoi``/``pick_dataset`` nudge migrations
(aoi_choice, dataset_choice) - see wri/project-zeno#770. This is a deterministic
substitute for LLM-judged clarification detection whenever a test case expects
one of these specific nudge shapes: the nudge type and options are read
directly off agent state instead of inferred from prose.

Both the nudge type and the option wording are themselves LLM-generated for
aoi_choice/dataset_choice nudges (only the literal send_nudge-with-fixed-args
case is fully deterministic), so both comparisons below are deliberately
loose: type accepts a semicolon-separated set of acceptable values, and
options match by case-insensitive substring containment rather than exact
equality, so annotation drift (e.g. "Tree cover loss" vs "Tree cover loss
(annual)") doesn't fail the check.
