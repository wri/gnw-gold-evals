"""Nudge evaluator.

A nudge is the agent's structured follow-up offer: the ``nudge`` state field,
``{type, options, data?}``, holding a choice for the user to pick from. The
``send_nudge`` tool sets it, as do ``pick_aoi`` and ``pick_dataset`` when they
offer a choice of place or dataset (types ``aoi_choice`` and ``dataset_choice``).
When a case expects a specific nudge, this check reads its type and options
straight from state: a deterministic alternative to the LLM clarification judge,
which infers clarification from prose.

Both the nudge type and the option wording are themselves LLM-generated for
aoi_choice/dataset_choice nudges (only the literal send_nudge-with-fixed-args
case is fully deterministic), so both comparisons below are deliberately
loose: type accepts a semicolon-separated set of acceptable values, and
options match by case-insensitive substring containment rather than exact
equality, so annotation drift (e.g. "Tree cover loss" vs "Tree cover loss
(annual)") doesn't fail the check.
