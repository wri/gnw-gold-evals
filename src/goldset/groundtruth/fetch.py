"""Resolve every ground-truth case before any trial runs.

Two failure classes, deliberately handled differently:

- the fetch itself failing -> **aborts the run**
- the selector not resolving against an otherwise-good response is recorded on
  the entry as ``unresolved`` and becomes a **row error at scoring time**. The
  fetch worked; this one case's metric is absent, which is a finding about that
  case rather than a reason to kill the run.
